Hi Welcome to my Yelp application Challenge. 
 

If you are on git and want to download and install this:

Simply type into your command line: 

git clone https://github.com/kotentie/Yelp.git "name you want to give folder"



I've found that some browsers have trouble accepting a json object without headers from a server. If that happens try using this command:


python -m SimpleHTTPServer


it will launch a very basic server that will wrap the json file in the appropriate headers.

Thanks for giving me a shot Yelper!

Cheer,
Jake
